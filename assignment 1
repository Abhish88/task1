Difference between range and xrange function?
In python2 range is classfied as a type list and xrange as xrange
however in python3 range is classified as range and there exists no xrange
the main difference between range and xrange in python2 is the sequence of elements(list) are executed once at a time in range.
whereas in xrange is lazyily evaluated one at a time, one after another.
